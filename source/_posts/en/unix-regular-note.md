This is my note learning UNIX.

## Startup

### Login
* Using ssh/telnet…

### Shut Down
`halt init 0 init 6 poweroff reboot shutdown`

### Manual
`man -k permission [SNYOPSIS] - arguments`


## Users and Groups

### Type of Accounts
* System accounts: apache/bin/guest…
* User accounts
* Group accounts: One account belongs to multi groups

### Admin Users and Groups
* 3 main files for user management
    * `/etc/passwd`
    * `/etc/shadow`
    * `/etc/group`

* Commands to manage users and groups
    * `useradd`
    * `usermod`
    * `userdel`
    * `groupadd`
    * `groupmod`
    * `groupdel`

* Shell location: `/bin/bash`
* `who` / `whoami` (current) / `who am i`(init)


## File System

### Basic File Commands
* find pathname options

`find /usr -name lostfile (recursive by default)`

* `which` and `whereis`
    * `which`: find file in users’ PATH
    * `whereis`: find in system’s path

* `echo directory*` = `ls`    

### Links
* Hard link: same inode
* Soft link: different inode, ref by name `ls -i`
* `cat`
* Add line to file tail `echo "Hey">>filename`
* Edit link will change content of origin file

### Files and Directory Permissions
* r-read / w-write / x-execute
* Output from `ls-l` `-rwxr-xr--`
    * Permission for file owner
    * Permission for group
    * Permission for others

### Change Permissions
* `chmod` in symbol mode `chmod [u/g/o][+/-/=][rwx] filename`
* `chomod` in absolute mode `chmod [7=r4+w2+x1]40 filename`
* `chgroup groupname filename`
* `umask` configs default permission of shell created files by minus it from 777, if wants it default, saves it to .profile

### View File
* `more filename` show file in a screen. Press Enter to move on
* `less filename` use vi keys to operate
* `head -n 15 filename` view 15 lines of file, 10 or 15 lines by default
* `tail -n 15 filename`
* `tail -f(follow) filename`
* `wc filename` see files length count by words
* `wc -[c/l/L] filename` count by chars/lines/length of longest line

### Create/Change/Delete File
* `cp fromfile tofile`
* `mv fromfile tofile`
* `touch filename`
* `rm -f(don't ask) -r(recursive) filename(can be *)`

### Create/Delete Directory
* `mkdir dirname`
* `rmdir dirname(must be empty)`
* `rm -r` can delete dir that is not empty

### Basic File System Management
* `df -k` show disk space in KB
* `df -h` readable way to show usage
* `du -h` path show usage of a dir
* `fsck` user a super block to trace file system, can repair file system
* `mount` see current file system


## Modify Working Environment

### Environment Variable
* `PS1="> "` controls command prompt
* Some escape chars:
    * `\t` current time
    * `\d` current week
    * `\s` current shell
    * `\W` working dir
    * `\t` complete working dir
    * `\u` current username
    * `\h` current host name
    * `\#` current command number
    * `\$` if UID==0, shows #, else shows $

### Path
* `$PATH` includes dirs that contains binarys
* `PATH=$PATH: /root: /home/ewind` add multi values to PATH variable in bash shell
* Add `export PATH` to init file will make PATH variable available in other shells
* Absolute path and relative path
    * `/path/to/file` is absolute path, based on `/`
    * `path/to/file` is relative path, based on current path

### Choose Shell
* `bash / sh` enter bash / Bourne shell
* `exit` to exit
* `chsh` to change shel

### Universal
* `/etc/profile`
* `set` check out current environment variables
* `alias rm = "rm -i"` in shell profile


## Understanding Unix Commands

### Metacharacter
* `?` for any 1 char
* `*` for any 1 char or more
* `[]` for any 1 char in []

### Output Redirect
* `ls > lsoutput` takes output of `ls` and write it to lsoutput (create it if not exists)

### Input redirect
* `sort <terms> terms-alpha` input terms to `sort` and write out to terms-alpha
* `0` for stdin
* `1` for stdout
* `2` for error
* `myprog 2 > errfile` makes error logs
* **These redirects only work for files**

### Pipe
* Pipe combines input and output redirect, put the output of one command directly the input of another command.
* `ls -l /etc | more`
* `sort < terms > terms-alpha | mail fred` becomes command chain

### Command Replacement
* `ls $ (pwd)` creates a child shell, and exec command in this child shell, whose output becomes the input of left command.
* `ls ${pwd}` or `ls 'pwd'` works the same


## vi

### Basics
* Command mode: `esc`*2
* Insert mode: `i`

### Move Cursor
* `h` left
* `j` DOWN
* `k` UP
* `l` right
* `10j` DOWN 10 lines
* `0` start of line
* `$` end of line
* `w` next word
* `b` previous word
* `W` next word, ignore symbols
* `B` previoust word, ignore symbols
* `(` start of sentence
* `)` end of sentence
* `ctrl-F` forward screen
* `Ctrl-B` backward screen
* `G` final line
* `xG` go to line x
* `:x` go to line x
* `set nu` show line number
* `set nomu` hide line number
* `ctrl-G` show cursor position

### Search File
* `/string` search string
* `/ string` search words begin with string
* `?string` search string backword
* `n` next instance
* `N` previous instance

### Exit and Save File
* `:q` quit vi
* `:w` save file
* `:wq` save and quit
* `:q!` execute command without confirms
* `ZZ` save and quit
* `w filename` save file as filename but stays in origin file
* `e!` open final version
* `w>>filename` add current content to tail of filename

### Insert File
* `i` insert before current cursor
* `I` insert at start of current line
* `a` insert after current cursor
* `A` insert after end of current cursor
* `o` new line after current line
* `O` new line before current line

### Delete File
* `x` delete
* `X` backspace
* `dw` delete word, including following space
* `D` delete from cursor to end of line
* `dd` delete whole line

### Modify File
* `cc` delete currrent line and go to insert mode
* `cw` delete current word(from cursor position) and go to insert mode
* `r` replace current word, then return to command mode
* `R` replace multi words, use `esc` to stop
* `s` replace current word and stay in insert mode
* `S` replace multi words and stay in insert mode

### Helps
* `J` combine current line and next line
* `yy` copy current line
* `yw` copy current word
* `p` paste after cursor
* `P` paste before cursor
* `u` cancel last edit
* `U` cancel change of current line
* `ctrl-L` hide hint
* `:! command` run shell command

### Replace files
* `:s/to_be_replaced/to_be_replace_with` replace word on current line
* `:x,ys/to_be_replaced/to_be_replaced_with` replace word in x-y lines, $ for end
* `:s/to_be_replaced/to_be_replaced_with/gc` replace all, with confirm
* `\*` escape `*`
* `\<` for begin of word
* `\>` for end of word


## Advanced Tools

Sarcastic was what he was.
No, he was just sarcastic.

```

### Metacharacter
* `.` match a character
* `[]` match any character inside, like `[ab][a-z][A-Z0-9]`
* `*` match zero or more characters
* `[^insert_characters]` match any character but insert_characters
* `^` match only if search series at begin of line
* `$` match instance at end of line, like `c*t$`
* `\` find the following character
* `?` zero or one character

### Advanced Commands
* `grep` global regular expression print
    * `grep string file(s)`
    * `grep -v string file(s)` find lines doesn’t contain string
    * `cat /etc/password | grep root` combine commands
* `find path options` options can be `option1 arg1 option2 arg2...`
    * `-name passwd`
    * `-maxdepth n`
    * `-mindepth n`
    * `-mount` no remote files syetems
* `find /root -name testfile -size +100k -uid 0`
* `sort options`
    * `sort -d` in dict orders
    * `-f` ignore case
    * `-g` in numeric order
    * `-M` in month order
    * `-r` reverse order
    * `-u` ignore repeat values
* `tee` send command output to multi places
    * `ps -ef | tee /tmp/troubleshooting_file` display on screen and
    * `ps -ef | tee -a /tmp/troubleshooting_file` add on tail of file
    * `script` record all operations of user
    * `script -a /tmp/log` add logs to file
    * `exit` stop recording

## Process Management

### Process
* `ls -l /etc` `/etc` is target, `-l` is argument
* init has PID 1 and is parent to all processes. When new program starts, fork will generate a copy of current program, with different PID and same resourse
* `echo $$` to see current PID for shell

### Shell Script
* `./filename` to execute following lines: `#/bin/cat Hello World`

### Current Process
* `ps` to see process status
* `ps u` or `ps -l` to see details
* `ps ax` to see system process on OS X
* `ps -e` on Solaris
* `ps -o user,pid,ppid,vsz,comm` to see PID/parent PID/virtual memory usage
* `kill PID` to close process
* `ps auxww | grep Firefox` to see Firefox’s PID, then kill this PID
