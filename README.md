📝 My tech blog.

## About This Blog
This blog is my tech blog deployed on [coding pages](https://coding.net/pages/). Main modules include:

* 100+ Markdown posts.
* Hexo configurations.
* Custom theme with static front end demos. (Standalone repo maintained [here](https://github.com/doodlewind/jacman)).

Besides front end, I'm trying to combine technology and humanity in blog posts. Your involvement is **welcomed** if your're also interested in this.

## Quick Links

## Participation
Issues and pull requests are super welcomed for:

* Propose ideas you're interested in.
* Fix typos and mistakes.
* Improve UX for the site.
* Request new features.

For basic formatting, please use **SBC case（全角）** punctuation and keep **space** between Chinese and English words.

This blog is generated by [Hexo](https://hexo.io/). So to preview the change, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo, alone with its [theme](https://github.com/doodlewind/jacman) in `themes/jacman` path.
2. Install and go.

``` text
npm install -g hexo-cli
npm install
hexo server
```

To update the site, `hexo deploy` helps. But generally please submit issue or pull request for this 🙂
