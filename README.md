üìù My tech blog.

## About This Blog
This blog is my tech blog deployed on [coding pages](https://coding.net/pages/). Main modules includes:

* 100+ Markdown posts.
* Hexo configurations.
* Custom theme with static front end demos. (Standalone repo maintained [here](https://github.com/doodlewind/jacman)).

Beside front end, I'm trying to combine technology and humanity in blog posts. Your involvement is **welcomed** if your're also interested in this.
